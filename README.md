# Machine-Learning-Models-for-CKD-Prediction
This project explores the use of supervised machine learning models to predict CKD using a medical dataset. Key techniques include data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation (logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, random forests). The goal is to enhance early CKD detection and support better patient outcomes.
