# Machine-Learning-Models-for-CKD-Prediction
This project explores the use of supervised machine learning models to predict CKD using a medical dataset. Key techniques include data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation (logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, random forests). The goal is to enhance early CKD detection and support better patient outcomes.
# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) using various supervised machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset consisting of 491 records with 25 variables, we identify important patterns and relationships that can help in early diagnosis and management of CKD.

## Dataset

The dataset contains a mix of categorical and numerical variables, including patient demographics, biochemical measurements, and health history indicators. Early diagnosis of CKD is crucial due to its asymptomatic nature in early stages, which often leads to late detection and poor outcomes.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values.
- Distinguishing categorical and numerical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.

### 2. Machine Learning Models Applied
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**

To address class imbalance, we applied various feature selection and data balancing techniques.

### 3. Model Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score

## Key Results

Through rigorous model comparison, the analysis identified the most effective models for predicting CKD. The results demonstrated the potential of machine learning in supporting early diagnosis, which is critical in improving patient outcomes.

## Conclusion

This work highlights the importance of machine learning in tackling public health challenges like CKD, which remains underdiagnosed globally. By leveraging supervised learning techniques, this project shows the potential to enhance early detection and preventive measures.
